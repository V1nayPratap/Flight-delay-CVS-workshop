Predict flight delays by creating a machine learning model in Python:

Import airline arrival data into a Jupyter notebook and use Pandas to clean it. Then, build a machine learning model with Scikit-Learn and use Matplotlib to visualize output.

In this module, I:

Created an Azure Notebook and import flight data, 
Used Pandas to clean and prepare dat, 
Used Scikit-learn to build a machine-learning model, 
Used Matplotlib to visualize the output
